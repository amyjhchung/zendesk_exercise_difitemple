# Backgroud
In Asia, traditional religious is important for most people; there are over 12,000 temples in Taiwan and over 100,000 temples in Japan. Most people are used to visit temples frequently, and temples have become an essential part of traditional culture; for example, People went to the temple at a festival, asked for luck, and wanted direction from temples.

And the temple provides those services (e.g., luck chain, lucky poem) to the prayer to exchange donations,  But due to COVID, people can not go to the temple like before. Therefore, temples lost their income and lost their relationships with their believer. So our app will help the prayer (end users) to pray online and collect lucky chain and lucky poem online. At the same time, our client can collect their customer’s information more precisely and offer their service online to get income.

At first, I thought about “what kind of business is affected most because of Covid”. then I checked all the APP API Zendesk at first and then decided the API I would like to embed. In this exercise, I used Chat SDK V2.

When people lose the opportunity to pray in temples, life lacks a habit and culture. Most temples do not store customer information, so they cannot provide services to customers; moreover,  most temples lack donations and income. They are facing a crisis.
At the same time, I interviewed and gathered 5people's opinion and feedback of product.

# Obstacles in exercise

I decided to make an ios application at the beginning; however, Due to lack of coding experience, in my personal opinions, 
the direction of chat ios SDK was not so clear, 
I tried the demo on Github, but I still struggled, after I consulted with my ex-colleague, I changed to do android.

I used Zendesk android Demo-chat sample; it was easy to create a simple chat function, it was nice, but I think we can offer more different functions in the future. (eg. menu)
After I successfully used the Demo app to create a simple app, I decided to embed SDKs and develop a simple app.
But in the exercise process, this was the first time I started coding by myself, which allowed me to understand better the difficulties encountered in actual product development (for example, how to find alternatives Solution if I can’t make a function in a short period.), it also allowed me to use GitHub for the first time, so that I finally became not just a PM that only talks but does not do anything.
Simultaneously, when I use the SDK, I also find that it is not easy to read the files. For example, some files are in different places on the website. I think that increasing customers (especially customers who are not engineers like me) increase the difficulty of use.
